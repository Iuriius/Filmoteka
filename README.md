An online movie theater project where you can find movies, add and remove them from your collection, switch to the dark mode and use pagination. My personal contribution to this project was a custom scroll-up button as well as a custom spinner I specially made for it in Adobe After Effects. As a scrum master of the project I wrote a big deal of JavaScript logic connected with functionality of the page and fixed some final bugs. Pictures of all contributors also were edited by me.
